Abalones are marine gastropod mollusks, basically seal snails. These mollusks are important for various reasons involve both their physical attributes, which majority makes the abalones sought in the food industry as well as natural habitat. However, many abalone, due to this demand, must be preserved and monitored in order to be still be accessible later in the future. This project covers the technique of predicting the age of abalone using age and its other physical attributes. The experiment is done through the Supervised Machine Learning technique of regression and is implemented using the Pycaret machine learning automation Python library.
